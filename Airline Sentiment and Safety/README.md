# Airline Safety Analysis
This project aims to analyze airline data to determine if flying is safer today than it has been in the past. The study also aimed to discover if a major event (in this case the 9/11 terrorist attack) affects the number of passengers. Data was retrieved from tweets that occurred in 2017.

## Technologies
This project utilizes Python via Jupyter Notebook. Libraries include tweepy, csv, and pandas. Tableau was used to generate a majority of visualizations.
