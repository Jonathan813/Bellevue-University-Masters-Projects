# Animal Shelter Analysis
This project aims to gain insights about animal-related incidents in the DFW area. Iâ€™d like to analyze the type of animals that they take in the most, see if there is any correlation with the time of the year, and possibly a few other things.

## Technologies
This project utilizes R via RStudio. Libraries include ggplot2, dplyr, and forcats.
